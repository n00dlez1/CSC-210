My biggest issues with completing this were the following:

 Gradescope was completely unable to parse and process the .java file submitted.
    This was due to the fact that I had created the class name as draft_PA1. 
    I forgot that the class name **MUST** match the file name. Capitalization DOES matter.

 Completely failing test cases.
    Very minor error. I had written it as "File Name?" instead of "File name?" 
    This caused all test cases to fail.

Failing one test case (80/100).
    The test case that was failing was one that had a float in its list of integers (scores).
    My error was in initializing the sum variable with int, when I should have initialized it as double,
    so that it could handle both integers and floats.
