Okay.. So we have a starter file that already has some functionality and we need to create classes that can function in conjunction with this existing functionality.
So, the plan is to first look at and understand what is happening in the starter file, then move onto creating the requested classes..

Let''s begin.

STARTER FILE ANALYSIS:

  CLASS NAME: PA4MAIN

  METHOD NAME: main
    Function: 

  METHOD NAME: prompt
    Function: Prints all options. (Called in userInterface)

  METHOD NAME: userInterface
    Args:     User currentUser: a class instance representing the current user.
              UserCollection allUsers: a class instance representing a collection of all users.
              Library lib: a class instance representing all available songs.
              Scanner input: a Scanner object for user input.
              
    Details: Initalizes the selection at 0, meaning no option has been chosen. Displays greeting message. 
             It runs continuously until the selection equals EXIT_SELECTION, a variable of 10. (Initialized in class PA4MAIN)
             The selected executes different features, then uses input.nextInt() to read the next choice. If not valid integer, catches error with message.
             Calls prompt method.
              
    Function: Takes main method result (a selection of 10 choices) and executes a method depending on which choice is selected.
