Okay.. So we have a starter file that already has some functionality and we need to create classes that can function in conjunction with this existing functionality.
So, the plan is to first look at and understand what is happening in the starter file, then move onto creating the requested classes..

Let''s begin.

STARTER FILE ANALYSIS:

  CLASS NAME: PA4MAIN
    Function: Executes MAIN METHOD.

  CLASS NAME: userInterface
    Function: Takes main method result (a selection of 10 choices) and executes a method depending on which choice is selected.
              It catches invalid commands.
              Otherwise, if option 10, which is the exit command, it exits the while loop and prints "Bye!".
