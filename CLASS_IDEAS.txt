Now that I have finished analyzing the starter file provided, I will move onto brainstorming what to do for the classes required.

CLASS NAME: Song.java
  Arguments: public Song(String title, String artist)

  Methods: 
    public String getTitle()
      simple getter method. no print statements, just return.
    public String getArtist()
      simple getter method. no print statements, just return.
    public int getTimesPlayed()
      simple getter method. no print statements, just return.
      *IDEA: the class song should have a private instance variable set at 0 upon creation. 
             everytime the method Play() is called, increment the variable by 1. (AFTER, not before)
    public void Play()
      Print description of the song. In this instance, just call toString().
    public String toString()
      FORMATTED LIKE: "Title by Artist, timesPlayed play(s)" EX: "American Pie by Don McLean, 100 play(s)"

CLASS NAME: Library.java
  Arguments: public Library() (None)

  Methods:
    public Song getSong(String title)
    public void addSong(Song song)
    public void removeSong(Song song)
    public String toString()
      *NOTE: Every String within the Library must be called with .toString(), with a newline for each. 
             It must be printed in alphabetical order by song name... So how do I keep it in alphabetical order?
