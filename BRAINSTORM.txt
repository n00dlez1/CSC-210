Let's look at the current assignment guidelines, I will fill in what my thoughts are and any notes.

Design a CLASS HIERACHY. <- Important to pick efficient and well-rounded design, 20% of grade.

Simplified version of the UML class diagrams (Lecture)

-> Design class hierachy (UML)
-> Implement
-----> Use polymorphism
-----> Use two-dimensional arrays. (ex. int[][]) 

PA5MAIN.java (main method) should take in a file name. Use ONE scanner instance. be sure to close it.

Input Format:
rows: 1
cols: 1
PLANT (0,0) banana
PRINT
GROW 1
print

*notes:
  commands can be either lower or uppercase, include cases to handle both. 
  first line is # of rows (1 is 1 plot, which is 5 rows)
  second line is # of cols (1 is 1 plot, which is 5 cols)
  COMMAND line is PLANT (plot_coordinates) PLANT_TYPE --> *NOTE* Not necessarily third, this is actually a COMMAND too, but is just followed by more info.
    *NOTE* all plots are 5x5 but specific plants have specific positions within, 
  lines afterward are COMMANDS
  end program when no more lines read?

CLASS HIERARCHY(s) and IDEAS:
  INTERFACE: PLANT
  ABSTRACT CLASSES implements Plant:
  FLOWERS
    Sub-classes within abstract class:
      Iris...
  TREES
  VEGETABLES

So, interface plant, abstract classes are the categories, the sub-classes within are the actual types of specific plants.?


BUT we also need a Garden object with a 2D array or list of plant objects.
Screen object with a 2D array of characters that each plant can "print" its current representation into..
  HINT* [(Plant's row * 5) + cell row][Plant's col * size of plant) + cell col]
IMPORTANT NOTES: 
  if not using the PLANT Command,
  different categories of plants have different positions. (Flowers middle, Veggies top middle, Trees bottom middle)

BRAINSTORMING:
  The GROW HARVEST AND PICK commands should pass through the Garden object FIRST.
